## Architecture

QTrend follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern. This structure was chosen for its testability, separation of concerns, and the ability to handle complex data flows between UI components and backend logic. Key components include:

- **Model**: Responsible for handling data operations. This includes fetching trending repositories data from the GitHub API.
- **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data, and retains UI state, ensuring smooth handling of configuration changes like screen rotations.
- **View (Activity/Fragment)**: The UI layer, which observes data changes from the ViewModel and renders the UI accordingly.

## Technical Choices

Several core technologies and design patterns were selected to enhance app stability, performance, and ease of maintenance:

1. **Kotlin**: Kotlin was chosen for its modern syntax, compatibility with Java, and ability to write more concise, safer code.
2. **Coroutines**: To manage asynchronous tasks (e.g., API calls) without blocking the main thread. Coroutines provide a lightweight, efficient way to handle concurrency.
3. **Flows**: Flows were used for reactive data streams, allowing the UI to react in real-time to data changes.
4. **EventsBus**: To manage inter-component communication in a decoupled manner, ensuring efficient data sharing between fragments and activities.
5. **Fragments and Activity**: The app structure includes a single activity with multiple fragments to modularize and manage the UI effectively.
6. **Lottie Animations**: Lottie is used to add smooth animations for a more engaging user experience.

## Future Improvements

Some features and enhancements were not included due to time constraints but could improve the application for production use:

1. **Error Handling**: Currently, error handling is minimal. For production, implementing comprehensive error handling with clear feedback to users would improve UX.
2. **Unit Testing**: Adding unit and integration tests to cover critical components like the ViewModel and repository layers.

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin**: For app development
- **Coroutines**: For asynchronous processing
- **MVVM**: For architecture
- **Flows**: For reactive data streams
- **EventBus**: For event handling
- **Activity & Fragments**: For UI structuring
